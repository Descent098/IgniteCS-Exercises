# igniteCS-exercises
My solutions to the Winter 2019 Schulich ignite CS exercises

# Requirements
You will need to have processing downloaded [Website](https://processing.org/)

# Usage
Once you have processing installed just open the files and hit the little play button. 

# Additional info
I will only be posting the exercises I find are more challenging, if you want the solutions for any of the other exercises let me know.

# Note about processing
As I am learning more about it apparently it is an add on to languages instead of it's own language. All of the challenges have been completed in Java syntax.
